        RunAI is an independent running publication focused on practical advice for everyday runners—
        from your first 5K to your next marathon. We cover training plans, strength work, shoe and watch
        picks, nutrition, and staying injury-free.

      <p className="mb-4">
        Our approach is simple: clear guidance, tested ideas, and straight-to-the-point reviews.
        We value consistency, sustainable progress, and smart recovery as the foundation of better running.
